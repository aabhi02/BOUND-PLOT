# BOUND-PLOT

Approach to plot the bounds for the numbers

Import the required libraries
- matplotlib
- pandas
- random

1. Create a list of random numbers within the range of -1 to 1 with the decimal points rounded to 2 places.
2. Create a dataframe to store the numbers and then save it to an excel file called "bound.xlsx".
3. Upper bound is assumed to be 0.75 and lower bound is assumed to be -0.75.
4. Plot the boundary lines using axhline() method from matplotlib.pyplot.
5. Plot the value points using plot() method from matplotlib.pyplot.
